# ðŸ’¸ Sales and Profit Dashboard

This is a Power BI dashboard I made to break down **sales and profit data**. It shows which categories, products, regions, and customers bring in the most profit â€” and where things aren't going so well too.

## ðŸ“Š Whatâ€™s inside:
- Total Profit, Sales, Quantity, and Discount KPIs
- Monthly trend for sales
- Sales by category (Furnitureâ€™s really dominating)
- Profit breakdown by region, product, and even customer
- Filters for quarter and state so you can explore more

## ðŸ›  Tools I used:
- Power BI for everything
- DAX to calculate profit and custom measures

> I kept the design clean and interactive, with bold visuals and filters so itâ€™s easy to explore insights. This one helped me understand how to focus on *profit-based storytelling* in dashboards.
